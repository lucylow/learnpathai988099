## 📖 Overview

LearnPath.AI is an adaptive learning platform that creates personalized learning pathways powered by intelligent AI. It diagnoses knowledge gaps, curates resources, and adapts as you learn, making education more accessible, personalized, and engaging.

### 🎯 Problem

Traditional learning is one-size-fits-all: students follow the same linear curriculum even though they begin at different knowledge levels and learn in different ways. This causes:
- Boredom for advanced learners
- Confusion for struggling students
- Long teacher prep times for effective differentiation

### 💡 Solution

LearnPath.AI creates dynamic, concept-level learning pathways tailored to each student:
1. **Adaptive Assessment** - Identifies learning style and knowledge gaps
2. **AI-Powered Pathfinding** - Generates personalized learning sequences
3. **Smart Resource Curation** - Matches resources to learning preferences
4. **Real-time Adaptation** - Adjusts based on performance and engagement

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- 🧠 **Learning Style Assessment** - Identifies visual, auditory, reading, or kinesthetic preferences
- 📊 **Knowledge Gap Analysis** - Adaptive quizzes to pinpoint concept-level mastery
- 🗺️ **Personalized Learning Paths** - AI-generated sequences of resources
- 📈 **Progress Tracking** - Real-time analytics and achievement milestones
- 🎯 **Adaptive Resources** - Content matched to learning style and difficulty level

### User Experience
- ✨ Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient designs and micro-interactions
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface
